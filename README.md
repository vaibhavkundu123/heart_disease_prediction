Title: Heart Disease Prediction Using AI Technique

Project Statement

Using the electronic health medical data so created, multilevel classiﬁcation was employed to recommend a list of diseases and thus assist physicians in diagnosing or treating their patients’ health issues more efficiently. Once the physician diagnoses the disease of a patient, the next step is to consider the likely complications of that disease, which can lead to more diseases. Previous studies reveal that correlations do exist among some diseases. Considering these correlations, a k-nearest neighbours’ algorithm is improved for multilevel learning by using correlations among labels (CML-kNN). The CML-kNN algorithm ﬁrst exploits the dependence between every two labels to update the origin label matrix and then performs multilevel learning to estimate the probabilities of labels by using the integrated features.  Finally, it recommends the top N diseases to the physicians. Experimental results on real health medical data establish the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed CDS framework.

Outcomes:
	
Plenty of work and researches have been done to find out different methods of diagnosis of various types. It is an attempt to predict and diagnose the disease based on symptoms that occurs at an early stage.
